1) How much time did you spend on this assignment?
about 3-5 hours

2) What challenges did you face while implementing this assignment, and what kind of
help did you get to overcome these challenges?
My biggest issue was figuring out how to handle collisions, especially consistently. I
kept having issues where my add() and search() methods were inconsistent with each
other. I built debug tools to help fix this.

3) What are some things you did really well on this assignment?
I'm proud of the little things I built to make this assignment easier, like my debug
tools and helper methods.

4) If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I don't think I would have approached it any differently, I didn't get lost anywhere
trying to do something that wouldn't work, it just took a bit of time to get it
down and I don't think I could have taken a different approach to avoid that
entirely.


*There are also two easter eggs hidden in my program, one is only visible by looking in the
code (or by doing a bit of math), the other can be discovered with a bit of trial and error :)
